How API Works:

This API will take the firstName, lastName, email, and saleId in request body and send you mail to user with the sale id. 
This API will work with two saleId for each user i.e SUMMER2020 & WINTER2019, if saleId is other than above two ids will give you Invalid Sale Id. 
If we try to hit the api with same sale Id twice it will give you message like "Email Already Sent with this Sale Id" with status 403

Internals of API:

	When Request received will check any user in DB, 
if user found, will check any email sent with sale Id, if not sent will add into user schema. 
If user not found, will create user schema with saleId.

MongoDB: Used MongoDB as Database and mongo atlas which is cloud solution for mongodb. 
 
Schema/UserSchema: Will Store the User data along with Sale Ids 
Routes/User: API Exposed to validate the business logic and 
Services/gridmailer: Mailer method has functionality to send the mail with templates.
index.js: All internals and mongodb configs are defined in this file.
